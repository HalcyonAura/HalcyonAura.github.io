<p>Created at BeachHacks in California State University Long Beach in Long Beach California, this project sought to use image processing to create a calculator. The goal of this program would be to take a picture of a math problem written on paper, have the computer (and eventually the smartphone) recognize the symbols and numbers, and compute the answer. This project was worked on in OpenCV using python's handwriting database to read the numbers, as well as Java to run the file input/output of the images. 
</p>
<p>
While uncompleted and more so done in pieces so as to better conceptually explain our project, we found that the handwriting database, despite all it's entries, wasn't as effective as we'd hoped. The program required a lot of extra work to get the image recognition to cooperate. Given the time constraint of 24 hours instead of 36 like other hackathons, our progress was severely limited.</p>
