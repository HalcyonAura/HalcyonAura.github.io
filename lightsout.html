<p>As an honors contract idea and a way to expand my knowledge of GUIs and learn a new programming langauge at the same time I recreated a game called Lights Out. I wrote many iterations, first without the GUI and textbased so I understood how the game worked, and then with the GUI so the game wasn't excessively reliant on the GUI such as with Snake. I did the whole program in C and used SDL2 for the GUI. In the process of making this I also learned how to compile in C and SDL2, which is not as simple as Java.
</p>
<p>
The text version of the game itself took little time. Most of my time was spent learning SDL2 syntax and implementation and slowly getting images to load and cooperate. Having never worked with images in GUIs before this was yet another wonderful learning experience.</p>
