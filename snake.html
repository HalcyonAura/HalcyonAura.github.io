<p>As a group project for a software enterprise class, our group decided on remaking the classic snake game but with more visually diverse actions. Ideally, we wanted to take the original functionality and improve upon it. Time constraints and design aspects, as well as lots of bugs, prevented us from implementing more than we preferred. We ended up focusing our efforts on improving the classic functionality and adding new things one at a time after significant debugging. Quite a bit of time was spent working on the color changing aspect of the snake.

Primarily, the struggle was learning to work with Java's GUI: Swing and awt. In our group I was determined the one with the most GUI experience and assigned to complete that aspect. After many iterations, the GUI became very messy and a fair amount of the game play was made through Java's GUI. From this experience I learned a significant amount more about Java's GUI and understood even more. Panels, containers, etc., were confusing to me up until I finshed the GUI for this game. Now I would say I have a better base understanding and can build more off that than I did prior.</p>
