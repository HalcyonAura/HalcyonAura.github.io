<section class="description">
<p>I and a fellow student were in a Discrete Mathematics class for the spring semester of our freshman year. We both thought it would be a good idea to refine some of our Java language while also reviewing the first half of the semester's material. Completed in the style of a variety of old games, none so much as Zonk, we added a lot of humor to the dialogue to make it memorable and mildly infuriatingly punny. Due to time constraints, the choose your own advevnture aspect of it was greatly downplayed, and the game followed the player as they progressed through the different lands hosting different discrete knowledge.

A fair majority of this project focused on creative story telling, incorporating witty puns, but also read files from a specific starting point to a specific ending point. This was another honors contract that built upon what I had been learning in another class but far more in-depth (in regards to reading files).</p>
