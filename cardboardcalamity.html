<p>At this point in time I began going to hackathons, this project was created at HackArizona down at the University of Arizona in Tuscon. Our group wanted to make an app that could be sold in any type of scenario. We decided upon making a Google Cardboard app that would double as both a competitive game but also as a team building application. 
</p>
<p>
Our idea consisted of having two users using our app, and when using it would see the other's perspective. One person would have a diagram in front of them, the other would have a stack of legos, however, the person who has the object in front of them can only see the other person's materials. Working together they would then have to build the lego diagram or solve a puzzle. The competitive game aspect was impelemented by adding in powerups and debuffs that other teams in a similar set up could do to other teams to slow them down. 
</p>
<p>
Working in Android was definitely an experience, as was reading the API and examples of apps in a field completely new to me. For a first hackathon I ended of learning a lot more than I ever expected, even though it wasn't in-depth it was still a lot of information even if only just a taste.</p>
