<p>In freshman year I was using python for a class and decided to work with a fellow student in applying our studies. We decided to recreate tetris in python using a library called pygame. This became our honors contract (self directed project under our honors college) for the semester. Admittedly due to poor timing and not fully understanding the extent of our unpreparedness, we were unable to fully complete the game. Currently, this game only allows the user to move a box to an already denoted spot which will then clear a single line of blocks.

In the course of this project I had my first experience with GUIs outside of Java but also far more in-depth than I had ever gone. Not only did I learn how to create a very simplistic game window and mechanism, I also began learning how to read API's (pygame's specifically). This has served to be incredibly useful in my studies as I've progressed in my schooling.</p>
