<p>Working with another student, we decided to focus on the basics of Java's GUIs and focused on user input. While there was little design, the purpose of this project was simply to introduce ourselves to and learn to work with Java's GUI libraries Swing and awt. The concept of the game was simply to have the user guess a large numebr and receive feedback on their guesses to improve their next guess. They would be told if some of the numbers in their guess was correct, if some of the numbers were also in the correct place, and finally if they guessed the correct number. 
</p>

As with most school projects, as this became an honors contract (self directed project under our honors college) it was done outside of class during our free time which was limited. We did however learn considerably about Java's GUIs which was the project's intent, even if we did not implement as much as we had intended to due to time restrictions.</p>
