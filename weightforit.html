<p>With the goal of winning IBM's prize at SBHacks held at California State University Santa Barbara, we had to conceptualize an idea using IBM Watson and NodeRED. Our idea was to create a weight sensor that could be placed on shelves that would send notifications or build a shopping list when the object being observed began to run low. One example is laundry detergent. A full bottle would be placed on the sensor, the sensor would be cleared to take in the full weight, and from that point as it is used it will calculate the percentage remaining based on remaining weight compared to the starting value. After a certain percentage remains, an alert will be sent to a phone or other alert system to notify the user to get more detergent.

While we didn't get the prize, we did learn a lot about IOT from using IBM's apps and their resources. </p>
